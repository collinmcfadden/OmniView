# OmniView
Software to analyze images from a camera to watch over sports matches and detect when common injuries occur (such as concusions and ankle sprains).

# Collecting images 
Images of injuries of interest were searched in Bing.com and the links to the queried images were scraped from the page using the Google Chrome plug in called "Link Klipper."  The relevant URL's were placed in a text file, and were processed by parseBing.cpp to translate the Bing link to the original image link.
